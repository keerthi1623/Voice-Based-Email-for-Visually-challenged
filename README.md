**About** 

The "Voice-Based Email for Visually Challenged" initiative seeks to enable people who are Â visually impaired to send and receive emails by speaking commands. The system translates voice input to text and vice versa using speech recognition and synthesis technologies, providing seamless communication, accessibility, and independence in digital communication for those who are visually impaired.
